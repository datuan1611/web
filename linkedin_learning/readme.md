Using following metaprompts with Copilot:
1. explain this code
2. explain event-driven programming
3. @workspace explain how this code for a space game works
4. @workspace What are the different game events that the code handles?
5. what does the spritesheet do?
6. @workspace explain how this code for the digital terrarium works
7. @workplace can you create a digital terrarium project for me where I can have a terrarium in the center of the page, and have it pre-populated with the plants in the images/folder. The terrarium should have a layer of sand at the bottom, have curverd walls for the container, and allow me to drag and drop plants to move them within the terrarium walls. I want this implemented in simple HTML CSS and JS
